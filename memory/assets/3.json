      "value": "Raised in a wealthy but emotionally distant home, Nona found comfort only in her caretaker, Granny Guan. Her childhood shaped her independence and boldness. In college, she excelled in business and later launched a successful fashion brand blending racing culture with urban flair. Despite her intense emotions, she values loyalty deeply, and her duality of fierceness and warmth makes her unforgettable."
