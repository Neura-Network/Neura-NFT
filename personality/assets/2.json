      "value": "Quinna is a complex and magnetic woman, wild and flamboyant on the surface. She often grabs attention through humor and eccentric behavior, yet yearns for recognition and affection. A freedom-seeker, she challenges rules and finds meaning in the thrill of the unknown. Traumatized by deep emotional wounds, her apparent madness conceals a sincere search for peace and belonging."
